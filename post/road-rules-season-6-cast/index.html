-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=road-rules-season-2-the-second-adventure-intro---youtube>Road Rules Season 2: The Second Adventure Intro - YouTube<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#road-rules-season-2-the-second-adventure-intro---youtube>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VX47USoSSMc/hqdefault.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.sitO8zMVz04bIxQMVUvjvgHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="Road Rules Season 2: The Second Adventure intro - YouTube"><p><em>Source: youtube.com</em></p><blockquote><p>rules road season.</p></blockquote><ol><li>tangerine</li></ol><h2 id=road-rules---season-13-episode-4---rotten-tomatoes>Road Rules - Season 13 Episode 4 - Rotten Tomatoes<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#road-rules---season-13-episode-4---rotten-tomatoes>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://resizing.flixster.com/Sa6oC81fPQUEwlINUdTrHXj4MxE=/206x305/v1.dDs1NDg5MTA7ajsxODc3MTsxMjAwOzIzNTI7MjUwMw" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP._XkdC5pAJxG5Iehv5GPqVgAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Road Rules - Season 13 Episode 4 - Rotten Tomatoes"><p><em>Source: rottentomatoes.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Anime wallpaper is a popular way to add some extra excitement to your home screen.
